    			<p id="Awards"> Macklemore </p>
    			<p id="A2">Macklemore has two siblings. He became engaged to his girlfriend of seven years, Tricia Davis, on January 21, 2013. Macklemore voiced his support of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage in the song "Same Love", which also condemns homophobia in mainstream hip-hop, society, and mass media.</p>
    			<p id="A2">In August 2008, Macklemore admitted himself into rehab for drug addiction and alcoholism, and celebrated two years of sobriety before a brief relapse in 2011, which he describes in his song "Starting Over". He said in a 2012 documentary that he spent most of his twenties trying to combat his addictions and destructive way of life, saying "I want to be someone who is respected and not just in terms of my music. I want to be respected in terms of the way that I treat people... Music is my creative outlet in terms of expressing what is important to me; what has importance, what has a value. And I want to be respected for that." </p>
    			<p id="A2">Macklemore is a fan of the Major League Baseball team the Seattle Mariners. He dedicated his song "My Oh My" as a tribute to sportscasterDave Niehaus, who died in November 2010, with a performance before 50,000 fans who attended the 2011 Mariners Opening Day at Safeco Field. Following the performance, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis were each awarded a custom jersey embedded with a Mariners patch. He has acknowledged baseball and hip hop music as not being "intrinsically linked", "a bunch of people that are Mariners fans probably don't consider hip hop, like, real music still". Ryan Lewis announced that all proceeds from the song benefit the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club.  He also supports the Seattle Seahawks. </p>

He attended Ferris High School in Spokane, Washingtonand graduated from Roosevelt High School in Seattle. He graduated from the University of Washington majoring in Comparative History of Ideas. </p>
    			<p id="A2">Lewis became a professional photographer and videographer and started to take photos for Macklemore in the summer of 2006. In late 2008, after having produced a few trial run songs together, they collaborated fully on a project that later became the VS. EP.</p>
